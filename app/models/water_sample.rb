# Assignment:

# Implement the methods as specfied in the following class, plus any you need to use to make your life easier.
# Make explicit any dependencies on external libraries so that I can run your code locally.

# Los Angeles recently sampled water quality at various sites, and recorded the 
# presence of contaminants. Here's an excerpt of the table:
# (from: http://file.lacounty.gov/bc/q3_2010/cms1_148456.pdf)
# (All chemical values are in mg/L)
# | id | site                                      | chloroform | bromoform | bromodichloromethane | dibromichloromethane |
# |  1 | LA Aquaduct Filteration Plant Effluent    |   .00104   | .00000    |  .00149              |  .00275              |
# |  2 | North Hollywood Pump Station (well blend) |   .00291   | .00487    |  .00547              |  .0109               |
# |  3 | Jensen Plant Effluent                     |   .00065   | .00856    |  .0013               |  .00428              |

class WaterSample < ActiveRecord::Base

  # This class intends to ease the managing of the collected sample data, 
  # and assist in computing factors of the data.
  #
  # The schema it must interact with and some sample data should be delivered 
  # with your assignment as a MySQL dump

  def self.find(sample_id)
    # spec
    # sample2 = WaterSample.find(2)
    # sample2.site.should == "North Hollywood Pump Station (well blend)")
    # sample2.chloroform.should == 0.00291
    # sample2.bromoform.should == 0.00487
    # sample2.bromodichloromethane.should == 0.00547
    # sample2.dibromichloromethane.should == 0.0109

  end

  # Some Trihalomethanes are nastier than others, bromodichloromethane and 
  # bromoform are particularly bad. That is, water that has .060 mg/L of 
  # Bromoform is generally more dangerous than water that has .060 mg/L of 
  # Chloroform, though both are considered "safe enough".
  # 
  # We could build a better metric by adjusting the contribution of each 
  # component to the Trihalomethane limit based on it's relative "danger". 
  # Furthermore, consider we want to try several different combinations of 
  # weights (factors).
  # 
  # Sample table of Factor weights:
  # |  id   | chloroform_weight | bromoform_weight | bromodichloromethane_weight | dibromichloromethane_wieight |
  # |   1   |   0.8             |      1.2         |       1.5                   |     0.7                      |
  # |   2   |   1.0             |      1.0         |       1.0                   |     1.0                      |
  # |   3   |   0.9             |      1.1         |       1.3                   |     0.6                      |
  # |   4   |   0.0             |      1.0         |       1.0                   |     1.7                      |

  # In statistics, a factor is a single value representing a combination of 
  # several component values. We may gather several different variables, which 
  # semantically indicate a similar idea, and, to make analysis simpler, we can 
  # combine these several values into a single "factor" and disregard the 
  # constituents
  #
  # The weights that we should use in our factor could be a complex question. 
  # Ultimately it depends on what we're modeling.
  #
  # For example, let's say the city has the option of installing one of several
  # different filtration units to remove a specific Triahlomethane (but the city 
  # can't afford all of the filters). We can use differently weighted factors to
  # simulate each of these and do a cost / benefit analysis informing the city's
  # decision on which filtration unit to purchase.
  #
  # Let's say someone from the city has already computed various factors they
  # want to analyze, and put them in a factor_weights table.
  # In our case, we'll use a linear combination of the nth factor weights to compute the 
  # samples nth factor.
  #
  # 
  #
  # Return the value of the computed factor with id of factor_weights_id
  def factor(factor_weights_id)
    # spec:
    #  sample2 = WaterSample.find(2)
    #  sample2.factor(6) #computes the 6th factor of sample #2
    #    => .0213 
    # Note that the factor for this example is from data not in the sample data 
    # above, that's because I want you to be sure you understand how to compute
    # this value conceptually.
    factor = FactorWeight.find(factor_weights_id)
    weights = (self.attributes.keys - %w(id site)).map do |key|
      factor["#{key}_weight"] * self[key]
    end

    weights.inject(:+)
  end

  # convert the object to a hash
  # if include_factors is true, inlcude all computed factors in the hash
  def to_hash(include_factors = false)
    # spec:
    #  sample2.to_hash
    #   => {:id =>2, :site => "North Hollywood Pump Station (well blend)", :chloroform => .00291, :bromoform => .00487, :bromodichloromethane => .00547 , :dibromichlormethane => .0109}
    # sample2.to_hash(true) 
    # #let's say only 3 factors exist in our factors table, with ids of 5, 6, and 9 
    #   => {:id =>2, :site => "North Hollywood Pump Station (well blend)", :chloroform => .00291, :bromoform => .00487, :bro   modichloromethane => .00547 , :dibromichlormethane => .0109, :factor_5 => .0213, :factor_6 => .0432, :factor_9 => 0.0321}
